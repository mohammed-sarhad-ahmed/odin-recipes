        <h2>vegan burger recipe</h2>
        <p>Delicious black bean vegan burgers that are suitable for everyone! You don't have to adhere to the
            instructions or
            measurements exactly; I never do. Serve with sweet potato fries and your preferred burger toppings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>3 baby carrots, grated (Optional)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped sweet onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced green bell pepper (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®), or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 slices whole-wheat bread, torn into small crumbs</li>
            <li>¾ cup unbleached flour, or as needed</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>The direction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Mash black beans in a bowl. Add carrots, onion, bell pepper, and garlic; mix well.</li>
            <li>Whisk chile-garlic sauce, cornstarch, water, chili powder, cumin, seafood seasoning, salt, and black
                pepper together in
                a separate small bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir chile-garlic sauce mixture into black bean mixture; mix in bread crumbs. Stir flour, 1/4 cup at a
                time, into bean
                mixture until a sticky batter forms.</li>
            <li>Spoon mounds of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, about a 3/4-inch thickness per mound; shape into
                burgers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked in the center and crisp on the outside, about 10 minutes per
                side.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>pro tip</h2>
        <p>One egg can be substituted for cornstarch, but the recipe will not be vegan.</p>
